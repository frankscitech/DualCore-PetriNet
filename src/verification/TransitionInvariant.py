    re.subn(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)

    brief:  Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern 
            in string by the replacement repl. If the pattern isnâ€™t found, string is returned unchanged.
    return: a tuple (new_string, number_of_subs_made).
